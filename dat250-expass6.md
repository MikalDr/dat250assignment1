# DAT250: Software Technology Experiment Assignment 6

In this exercise we are looking at Angular, and connecting angular to REST API
Doing some googling, looking at the lecture slide as well as some Youtube tutorials, i managed to get a result
that seems to fulfill the requirements.

### Technical difficulties
One issue i encountered was that when Angular requested information from the REST API i would
get a CORS header error in the http request. After tweaking some config and adding a few lines to the
code i believe i managed to fix this. (it works on my system)
