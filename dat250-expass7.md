# Software Technology Experiment 7: Messaging Systems
In this exercise I followed the tutorials/walkthroughs on how to use RabbitMQ.

### Technical difficulties
I did not encounter any technical difficulties while doing this task.
Though i did most of the running of the applications from IntelliJ, using the run with parameters
option for the processes needing arguments.
