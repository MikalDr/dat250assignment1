# JPA-tutorila report


### Questions
- Can you find out which database is used and where the database stores its files?
  The database in this project is of the type H2, and is found at the top directory of the project, within the DB.my.db file.

- Can you provide the SQl used to create the table Customer (Hint: Hibernate is used for the object-relational-mapping)?

- Find a way to inspect the database tables being created and attach a screenshot of the database schema to your report. Do the created tables correspond to your initial thoughts regarding the exercise?

### Technical Problems
I encountered two problems while working with this task,
the first being difficulties to open and check on the H2 database file,
the other being that the assignment uses Collections within their diagrams on values that require more than one
value, this gives an error with the tests as they are of value Set.
