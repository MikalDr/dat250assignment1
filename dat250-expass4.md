# Expass 4 report

In this assignment we will look at CRUD operations using Spring and REST API.
I did not complete the optional tasks within the assignment

After starting the services running on localhost, i opened Postman to try using the GET and PUT operations.

Firstly the values were both zero, but after using PUT to update the values then extracting them once again using get they've been replaced, as expected.

### Technical issues
I did not encounter any issues with the download and usage of these tools as they were quite intuitive and simple in use.
