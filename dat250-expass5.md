There is not much to write about the task itself as it was just following instructions and getting an expected result.
### Technical difficulties
When following along the tutorials i had no issues, only a mild inconvenience as when i started the last guide i saw that they required some extra stuff which i did not initialize with the Spring Quick Start while doing the other tasks, but this was solved by just generating a new project using Spring.
